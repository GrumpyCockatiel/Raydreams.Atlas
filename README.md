## Configuration

You need to include an app.config file with keys at the same level as the .csproj file
For obvious security reasons it has been removed.

The Public and Private Key you will get inside your Atlas Dashboard (see below how to make the keys).

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <configuration>
        <appSettings>
        <add key = "publicKey" value=""/>
        <add key = "privateKey" value=""/>
        <add key = "projectID" value=""/>
        <add key = "clusterName" value=""/>
    </appSettings>
</configuration>
```
